## Installing on Desktop (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)

3. Click the install button
4. Confirm the installation
5. The app will be installed and can be launched from your applications menu

## Offline Functionality

- Swipe-based card interaction
- Three difficulty levels of cards

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble installing the PWA:

1. Make sure you're using a supported browser (Safari for iOS, Chrome for Android)
2. Ensure you're visiting the site over HTTPS
3. Check that your device supports PWAs (most modern devices do)
4. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page

For iOS users, note that PWAs have some limitations compared to native apps:
- Cannot be distributed through the App Store
- Limited access to device features like advanced camera functions
- May not appear in the app switcher in the same way as native apps
